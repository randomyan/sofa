This file is now deprecaetd.
You can replace the inclusion of this file by this one
<SofaImplicitField/deprecated/InterpolatedImplicitSurface.h>
Nevertheless it is better if you use the new <SofaImplicitField/component/geometry/DiscreteGridField.h>
which clearly separate what is specific to distance field and what is specific to geometry.
