Simulation of deformable object using a formulation similar to the KKT system for hard constraints, regularized using a compliance matrix.
Provides implicit time integration combined with constraint stabilization.

See code documentation generated by doxygen in doc/code/html/index.html.

See Compliant/doc/compliant.pdf and Compliant/doc/compliant-reference.pdf for more detail.

TODO: (what is missing)
- complex projective constraints (only partial identity = fixed constaints are handled now)
                    - solution1: the easiest: wait for Eigen to implement a sparse LDLT on semi-definite matrices
                    - solution2: the cleanest: the projective constraint component gives the projection matrice to the non-null space (rectangular matrix that reduces the nb of dofs, based on a svd of the constraint Jacobian?)
                    - solution3: the fast and dirty: add a numerical regularization in the constraint Jacobian
- constraint solver as post-process of a free dynamics (new numerical solver)
- handles sub-parts of the dynamics with different numerical solvers (=> having several Response components handling a sub-graph)
- specialized constraints with reparametrization (around 0 in the free directions) : Hinge, Slider...
